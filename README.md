# FEEDY

Lecturers often find it hard to rate how well their points are getting across to their students, and feedback often comes too late or is imprecise. Efforts to accurately assess student progress has historically required a lot of time and resources from lecturers. With Feedy, the lecturers get clearer and faster student feedback which allows them to improve their effectiveness as teachers, and gives students lectures tailored to their needs. Using this system, the lecturer will be able to track their studentsâ€™ understanding of each lecture using a quiz automatically generated from their lecture slides.
