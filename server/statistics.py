'''
For each topic we must generate:
    - number of answers
    - average percent
    - standard deviation
    - keywords with a total answer percent on less than 20% (numAnswered/answers_per_topic < 0.2)

Statistics are saved in db as "[topic1, answers_per_topic, avgPercent, standard deviation, keyword1, keyword2][topic2....]"
